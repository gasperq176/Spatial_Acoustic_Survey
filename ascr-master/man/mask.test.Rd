\title{Testing the mask object for a first calls model.}
\usage{
mask.test(fit = NULL, mask, traps, pars, cutoff, lower.cutoff,
  surface = FALSE, col = c("black", "blue", "red"), pincol = "red",
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A fitted model from \link{fit.ascr}.}

\item{mask}{A matrix with two columns. Each row provides Cartesian
coordinates for the location of a mask point. The function
\link{create.mask} will return a suitable
object. Alternatively, this can be a list of such matrices if
detections from multiple detector arrays are being used to fit
a single model.}

\item{traps}{A matrix with two columns. Each row provides Cartesian
coordinates for the location of a trap (or
detector). Alternatively, this can be a list of such matrices
if detections from multiple detector arrays are being used to
fit a single model.}

\item{pars}{A named list. Component names are parameter names, and
components are values of parameters at which the mask is to be
tested. Parameters must include \code{b0.ss}, \code{b1.ss}, and
\code{sigma.ss}; see \link{fit.ascr} for further details.}

\item{cutoff}{The upper cutoff value; see \link{fit.ascr} for
further details.}

\item{lower.cutoff}{The lower cutoff value; see \link{fit.ascr} for
further details.}

\item{surface}{Logical, if \code{TRUE} a 3D detection surface is
plotted over the mask point locations.}

\item{col}{Colours of points. Three colours are required if
\code{surface} is \code{FALSE}; otherwise, just one is
required.}

\item{pincol}{Colour of pins when \code{surface} is \code{TRUE}.}

\item{...}{Arguments to be passed to \link{plot}.}
