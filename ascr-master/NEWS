ascr 2.2.0
----------

* Implemented inhomogeneous density surfaces via the fit.ascr()
  argument ihd.opts. Density can be fitted as a smooth function of
  spatial covariates using mgcv syntax like s() and te().

* Fixed bug in locations() so that is correctly plots location
  contours for models with estimated distances.

* Fixed bug in fit.ascr() for multi-session models, so that it
  correctly estimates parameters when one or more sessions have zero
  or one detections.

ascr 2.1.1
----------

* Implemented multi-session models. Estimates are shared across
  sessions.

* Added the detfn() function, which calulates detection probabilities
  from an estimated detection function.

* Improved deletion of temporary files. These did not previously get
  deleted if fit.ascr() hit an error.

* For models with estimated bearings and distances, arrow lengths
  rather than circles are now used to depict esimated distances in
  plots generated by locations().

* Improved start values for some detection functions.

* Fixed bug in convert.capt.to.ascr() so that it works for capture
  history objects without signal strength information.

ascr 2.0.3
----------

* Various bug fixes, mostly for acoustic models.

ascr 2.0.2
----------

* Implemented a workaround for bootstrap resamples in which no animals
  are simulated in the population.

ascr 2.0.1
----------

* Bug fix---the get.mce() function was not previously exported.

* Implemented a workaround for bootstrap resamples in which no
  detections are made

ascr 2.0.0
----------

* Package renamed from `admbsecr' to `ascr'.

admbsecr 1.2.3
--------------

* Added truncated capture histories to the lightfooti data object.

admbsecr 1.2.2
--------------

* Minor bug fixes.

admbsecr 1.2.1
--------------

* Changed parameter `call.freqs' to `cue.rates' for accuracy.

* Added `survey.length' parameter to admbsecr(). Cue and animal
  densities are now both explicitly provided.

* Improved detection-to-cue matching algorithm.


admbsecr 1.2.0
--------------

* Added contours argument to show.detprob, allowing the detection
  probability surface to be plotted as contours rather than a 3D
  surface.

* Fixing signal strength contours so they are considered separate to
  detection locations. This allows them to be compared to contours
  from other auxiliary information types.

* Cleaner code for extracting Monte Carlo error.

admbsecr 1.1.3
--------------

* Bug fix to sim.capt(), also affecting boot.admbsecr(), for signal
  strength models with call.freqs specified as an argument.

* Created optimisation executables with the new ADMB version 11.3.

* Added the acoustic-secr vignette.

admbsecr 1.1.2
--------------

* Minor bug fixes.

* Added conversion function convert.capt.admbsecr() to allow for the
  conversion of a capture history from the secr format to the admbsecr
  format.

admbsecr 1.1.1
--------------

* Implemented first-call acoustic models.

* Added detector locations to show.detsurf().

admbsecr 1.0.8
--------------

* Implemented signal strength models with heterogeneity in source
  strength.

* Added argument 'phases' to admbsecr(), allowing parameters to be
  optimised in phases. This improves stability in of the optimisation
  process in come cases.

* Implemented spherical spreading signal strength models. Set
  'ss.link' component of 'ss.opts' to '"spherical"'.

* Various bug fixes.

admbsecr 1.0.7
--------------

* Implemented directional calling models. Only available with signal
  strength detection functions.

* Signal strength cutoff and link function for admbsecr() are now
  specified using the argument 'ss.opts'. A logical indicator for
  whether or not a directional calling model is set here, too.

* Added arguments plot.contours and plot.estlocs to locations(). These
  control whether or not contours and modes of location densities are
  plotted.

admbsecr 1.0.6
--------------

* Improved efficiency of likelihood calculation. Integration over the
  survey area to obtain the probability of a binary capture history
  now only occurs for each *unique* capture history.

* Added argument 'local' to admbsecr(); when TRUE, integration over
  the survey area only occurs at mask points within the buffer
  distance of all traps at which a detection was made.

* Changed the format of the example data, so that various components
  appear in a single list.

* Bug fix to convert.capt(), allowing the cutoff value to be passed to
  the secr capthist object.

* Added a new install script so that installation no longer relies on
  R-forge.

admbsecr 1.0.5
--------------

* Added test.admbsecr() function, to allow testing without tests
  having to pass on the R-forge servers.

admbsecr 1.0.4
--------------

* Bug fixes, which prevented any mask from the secr package to be used
  with admbsecr().

* Added shading to plots generated by show.detsurf().

* Added extra information (detection function, information types) to
  output from summary().

admbsecr 1.0.3
--------------

* Added argument 'hess' to admbsecr(). This means calculation of
  standard errors, the variance-covariance matrix and the correlation
  matrix can be foregone to save processing time. This is particularly
  useful for the function boot.fit(), where estimation of parameter
  uncertainty for each individual simulation is not required.

* Added function get.bias(), which extracts estimated bias from an
  object of class admbsecr.boot.

* Added function convert.pamguard(), which creates a capture history
  for a PAMGuard detection file.

* Added method "default.bc" option to confint.admbsecr.boot. This is
  similar to method "default", but additionally performs a bias
  correction.

* Bug fix to locations() used on model fits using TOA.

* Added exported data from an acoustic survey of the Western Cape moss
  frog.

admbsecr 1.0.2
--------------

* Some bug fixes to fitting signal strength models with a log-link
  function.

* Added S3 methods for the summary() and confint() generic
  functions. The confint() method can calculate a range of different
  intervals, including a number of bootstrap techniques.

* Added the calculation of Monte Carlo error in estimates of biases
  and standard errors calculated using boot.admbsecr(). The function
  get.mce() can be used to extract these.

* Added arguments cbs and gbs to admbsecr(). Changing these from the
  defaults can potentially decrease computation time if ADMB is
  writing large cmpdiff.tmp and gradfil1.tmp files during
  optimisation. It is only recommended users familiar with ADMB change
  these.

admbsecr 1.0.1
--------------

* Completed rewrite of admbsecr. The admbsecr() function can be used
  without installing AD Model Builder on to the local machine.

* The package is restored to its previous functionality, with a few
  changes:

    * The contours() function has been renamed to locations().

    * All previous references to "angles" have now been changed to
      "bearings".

* There are also some additional features:

    * The boot.admbsecr() function can be used to carry out a
      parametric bootstrap, and is set up for parallel
      processing. This replaces the function se.correct().

    * The function create.mask() has been added, to create a mask
      object suitable for use as the 'mask' argument to admbsecr().

    * Functions convert.capt(), convert.mask(), and convert.traps()
      convert capture history, traps, and mask objects to objects that
      are compatible with the secr package.

    * Functions show.detsurf() and show.survey() plot the estimated
      detection probability surface, and the survey layout,
      respectively.

* All documentation has been written in full, with examples.

* Testing using the testthat package has been implemented for all
  exported functions.

admbsecr 0.2.1
--------------

* First stage of admbsecr rewrite. Most notably, any combination of
  supplementary information is now possible, and AD Model Builder does
  not have to be installed by the user. The admbsecr() function now
  has new syntax; in particular, the capture history object is now a
  list, with a component for each type of supplementary information to
  be fitted.

* Much of the old admbsecr functionality is gone; e.g., plotting
  contours and detection functions. This will be re-added in version
  1.0.1.

admbsecr 0.1.5
--------------

* Major bug fix. Until now, method "sstoa" did not fit the correct
  model unless the optional argument 'sstoa' was properly specified.

* Added a new function, sim.capt(), which simulates a capture history
  array using either provided parameter values or those from a model
  object.

* Added functions calc.detfn() and show.detfn(), which calculate
  detection probabilities and plot estimated detection functions,
  respectively.

* Added function se.correct(), which corrects standard errors via a
  bootstrap-like method in situations where multiple rows of the
  capture history correspond to a single individual.

* Added the argument sound.speed to admbsecr(), allowing the user to
  specify the speed of sound. Only used for methods using time of
  arrival data. Defaults to 330 m/s.

* Added 'scalefactors' argument to admbsecr() to allow for better
  fitting when parameters are of different magnitudes.

* Added 'circles' argument to contours(), so that the plotting of
  circles representing estimated distances is now optional.

* Reparameterisation of the signal strength and threshold detection
  functions. For the signal strength detection function, the parameter
  'ssb1' is now always positive. For the threshold detection function,
  larger "shape" means higher probability of detection at distance 0,
  larger "scale" means animals further away are more easily
  detected. Before these were the cases as the parameters decreased,
  which was not very sensible.

* Added additional methods:

    * "angdist" -- SECR with both estimated angles and distances to
      animals.

    * "ssmrds" -- SECR with known animal locations and recorded signal
      strengths. Mostly of academic interest to see the sampling
      distribution of our estimates when we use all the spatial
      information we possibly have while fitting a signal strength
      model.

admbsecr 0.1.4
--------------

* Added further methods to contours() function. It now works with
  the "dist" and "mrds" methods.

* When contours() is used on a fit of method "ang", arrows are plotted
  from the traps, indicating the estimated bearing of the animal.

* The labels on contour plots now correspond to the estimated
  probability of the individual being located within the contour,
  rather than probability density.

* The user can specify the (approximate) probability values at which
  contours will be drawn.

* A new argument ('detfn') has been added to admbsecr(), allowing the
  user to choose a detection function. Options are "hn" (halfnormal),
  "hr" (hazard rate), "th" (threshold), and "logth" (log-link
  threshold).

* The signal strength method now allows a log link function for
  expected received signal strength. This is done from a call to
  admbsecr using the arguments 'method = "ss", detfn = "log"'.

admbsecr 0.1.3
--------------

* Added functions mrdstrapcov() and disttrapcov(), which fit SECR
  models in the specific case where:

    * There are only two traps, both at the same location.

    * Additional information is the estimated or exact distance
      the animal.

    * Each trap is associated with its own halfnormal detection
      function.

  Eventually these specific cases will also be handled by admbsecr().

* Added further methods to contours() function. It now works with
  methods "sstoa", "ang", and "disttc".

* Further cosmetic improvements to contours().

* The admbsecr() function now accepts an argument which fixes
  parameters at a specific value.

admbsecr 0.1.2
--------------

* Added additional method:

    * "mrds" -- SECR with known animal locations. Equivalent to
      mark-recapture distance sampling.

* Added contours() function, which plots estimated animal location
  densities. This currently works with fits from methods "simple",
  "toa", and "ss".

* Major bug fix: Methods "ang" and "dist" did not work, as a file
  (bessel.cxx) needs to be available.

* Minor bug fixes regarding error and warning messages.

* Capture history matrices with more than one session now result in an
  error message.

* A log link function is no longer used to calculated expected
  received signal strength for methods "ss" and "sstoa". Eventually
  both options will be available to the user.

admbsecr 0.1.1
--------------

* Added additional method:

    * "dist" -- SECR with estimated distance information.

* Added the parameter `bounds` to admbsecr(). This allows the user to
  specify bounds on any parameters they wish to, overriding the
  defaults.

* A log link function is now used to calculate expected received
  signal strength for methods "ss" and "sstoa".

* Bug fix to `profpars` parameter of admbsecr(). Profile likelihood
  now works.

* Bug fix to issue with specifying start values in a named vector out
  of order.

admbsecr 0.1.0
--------------

* Initial release of admbsecr.

* Implemented methods are:

    * "simple" -- SECR with no additional information.

    * "toa" -- SECR with time-of-arrival information.

    * "ang" -- SECR with angle information.

    * "ss" -- SECR with signal strength information.

    * "sstoa" -- SECR with both signal strength and time-of-arrival
      information.
