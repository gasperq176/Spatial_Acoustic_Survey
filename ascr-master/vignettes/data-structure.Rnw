\section{Introduction}

In order to carry out analysis with \texttt{ascr}, three objects are required:
\begin{itemize}
\item A capture history object, \texttt{capt}, providing information
  about which individuals/calls were detected by which detectors (see
  Section \ref{sec:capt}).
\item A detector locations object, \texttt{traps}, providing the
  detector locations (see Section \ref{sec:traps}).
\item A mask point locations object, \texttt{mask}, providing the
  discrete locations of mask points over which numerical integration
  occurs (see Section \ref{sec:mask}).
\end{itemize}

\section{Compatability with \texttt{secr}}

Data input for the \texttt{ascr} package is designed to work
similarly to the procedures used by the \texttt{secr} package. The
functions \texttt{convert.capt.to.ascr()} and
\texttt{convert.capt.to.secr()} convert capture history objects used by
\texttt{secr} to objects suitable for analysis with \texttt{ascr},
and vice versa. For example, \texttt{signalCH} is an exported data
object from the \texttt{secr} package. Appropriate \texttt{capt} and
\texttt{traps} objects can be generated using
<<convert, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE>>=
ovenbird.capt <- convert.capt.to.ascr(signalCH)
ovenbird.traps <- traps(signalCH)
@ 

An appropriate \texttt{mask} object can be generated using the
\texttt{create.mask} object, for example
<<convert-mask, eval = FALSE, tidy = FALSE>>=
ovenbird.mask <- create.mask(traps = traps, buffer = 200)
@ 

\section{Capture data format}
\label{sec:capt}

The \texttt{capt} object must be a list with the compulsory named
component \texttt{bincapt}, the binary capture history. This is a
matrix with $n$ rows and $k$ columns, where $n$ is the total number of
detected individuals/calls, and $k$ is the total number of detectors
used. The $j$th element in the $i$th row should take the value $1$ if
the $j$th detector detected the $i$th individual/call, and take the
value $0$ if it did not.

There are four optional components that can be used, each
corresponding to a type of additional information collected by the
detectors:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{bearing}, for estimated bearings (in radians).
\item \texttt{dist}, for estimated distances (in metres).
\item \texttt{ss}, for received signal strengths.
\item \texttt{toa}, for measured times of arrival since the beginning
  of the survey (in seconds).
\end{itemize}

In all cases, these are matrices where the $j$th element in the $i$th
row either corresponds to the corresponding estimated or measured data
(if the $j$th detector detected the $i$th individual/call) or a value
of $0$ (if the $j$th detector did not detect the $i$th call).

The easiest way to create this object is via the \texttt{captures}
data frame; see the section \emph{Capture data format} in the
\texttt{secr} package vignette \emph{Data input for
  \texttt{secr}}. This is a data frame where each row corresponds to a
detection of an individual/call at a detector. It has four variables:
\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Session}: Identifies the session.
\item \texttt{ID}: Identifies the individual/call that was detected.
\item \texttt{Occasion}: Identifies the occasion.
\item \texttt{Detector}: Identifies which detector detected the
  individual/call.
\end{itemize}

As \texttt{ascr} does not (yet) support multi-session or
multi-occasion data, the first and third columns of this data frame
are ignored. If additional information has been collected by the
detectors, then this information should appear in subsequent columns
with the appropriate names (\texttt{bearing}, \texttt{dist},
\texttt{ss}, or \texttt{toa}).

\section{Detector location format}
\label{sec:traps}

The \texttt{traps} object must be a matrix with $k$ rows and two
columns. Each row provides the Cartesian coordinates of a detector.

\section{Mask point location format}
\label{sec:mask}

See the section \emph{Habitat mask} in the \texttt{secr} package
overview vignette for a brief explanation of the mask object. Mask
objects created for analysis using the \texttt{secr} package should
also be compatible with \texttt{ascr}.

The functions \texttt{create.mask()} (in \texttt{ascr}) and
\texttt{make.mask()} (in \texttt{secr}) are both capable of creating
suitable mask objects.
